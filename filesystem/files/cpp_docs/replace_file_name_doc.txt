std::filesystem::directory_entry::replace_filename
 C++ Filesystem library std::filesystem::directory_entry 
void replace_filename( const std::filesystem::path& p );
void replace_filename( const std::filesystem::path& p, std::error_code& ec );
(since C++17)
Changes the filename of the directory entry.

Effectively modifies the path member by path.replace_filename(p) and calls refresh to update the cached attributes. If an error occurs, the values of the cached attributes are unspecified.

This function does not commit any changes to the filesystem.

Parameters
p	-	the path to append to the parent path of the currently stored path
ec	-	out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload
Return value
(none)
